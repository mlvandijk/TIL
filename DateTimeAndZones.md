# Dates, times and time zones in Java

Central European Time (CET) is UTC +1.
Central European Summer Time (CEST) is UTC +2.

[**ZoneOffset**](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/ZoneOffset.html) = A time-zone offset from Greenwich/UTC. For example, +02:00.


A [**ZoneId**](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/ZoneId.html) is used to identify the rules used to convert between an [Instant](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/Instant.html) and a [LocalDateTime](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/LocalDateTime.html).
